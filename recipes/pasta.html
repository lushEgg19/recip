    <p>Pasta is a food made from wheat flour and water, mixed into an unleavened door and boiled (or sometimes baked). For fresh pasta eggs are also added to the dough. Pasta is a carbohydrate, with some fibre and protein, and whilst thought of as an Italian food (Italy is where most pasta recipes originate) it is likely descended from Asian noodles brought to Europe from China in the 13th century.</p>
