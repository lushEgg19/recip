    <p>Traditionally, chili combines ground or coarse-chopped beef (or other meat), dried red chili powder, onion, garlic, some liquid, and sometimes comino, oregano, beef suet, tomato, and masa (finely ground corn meal) to thicken. Texas-style chili has no beans. Southerners and Midwesterners generally add beans.</p>

        <li>2 tablespoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chipotle pepper sauce</li>
        <li>2 ½ teaspoons dried basil</li>

        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion, bell pepper, Anaheim pepper, jalapeno peppers, and garlic in the hot oil until softened.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add Worcestershire sauce and garlic powder. Crumble bouillon cubes over beef and add beer. Continue to cook , scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet, until liquid is hot, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir beef mixture into pepper mixture.</li>
        <li>Stir crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and wine to the beef mixture. Season with chili powder, 2 tablespoons cumin, brown sugar, pepper sauce, basil, paprika, salt, oregano, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer until meat and vegetables are very tender and flavors have developed in the chili, about 90 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Mix kidney beans into beef and vegetables. Continue to simmer until beans are hot, about 30 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Blend sour cream, cilantro, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon cumin in a food processor until smooth. Serve sour cream mixture with chili.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
